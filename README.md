A simple recreation of the Teeny Titans mobile game series' combat system.

<b>This repo has an ommitted folder called /_ImportedPackages/ that contains various free and paid assets that I don't own.</b>

With that being said, it will likely have errors if you try and open up the main, SampleScene.

This repo exists to showcase the simple code for the project. If you would like more information, feel free to contact me!
